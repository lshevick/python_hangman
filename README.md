# Python Hangman

Build a hangman game which gets a random word and shows that word to the user with blank spaces, such that a word (e.g. flavor), is shown as _ _ _ _ _ _.
Then, the user can input a letter and the script will determine wether or not that letter appears in the chosen word. If the user guesses a letter correctly (e.g. the letter 'o'), the script will display _ _ _ _ o _. If the user guesses incorrecty, the script will display something along the lines of "You guessed incorrectly, 5 guesses remaining."

## Hey Mikey Mode
If you have time, implement some ASCII art that gives the user a visual representation of a hangman that loses body parts when incorrect guesses are made.
